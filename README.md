## Hi there 👋  
# Elif Yurduseven 🎓🤖  

I'm a passionate engineering student from Turkey 🇹🇷, currently studying **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** at **Konya Technical University**. I’m interested in **AI**, **embedded systems**, **robotics**, and **cybersecurity**.

Currently involved in:  
- 🤖 **Teknofest Underwater Robotics Team** – working on Pixhawk, PX4 & Gazebo simulation  
- 🧠 Developing an **AI-based food additive scanner app**  
- 🔐 Learning **ethical hacking** through BTK Akademi  

I believe in using technology to solve real-world problems and create meaningful impact 🚀.
